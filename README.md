# hoofoobot
It's a discord bot that I made to learn more Rust and some of interesting techs and startups!

Made with [Poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) + [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity), designed to run on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/), and use [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) to keep its data.

## A couple of features
### Voice time recorder
This bot will record how long your server members has been on the voice chat. It even records how long they are in AFK channel (if your server have one).

It also have a nice leaderboard so you can show off to everyone that you have no life! :D

Currently there is no AFK leaderboard, it is on progress.

### Graveyard channel category helper
This bot can also help you move channels to a graveyard or inactive category with a single command!

### Unimportant and hidden features
There is also hidden features, mostly for development purpose like incrementing a member's voice time and force reset member's voice state

## Future features
Here are some features that I might implement in the future
### Leaderboard
- [ ] AFK leaderboard
- [ ] Custom leaderboard title and subtitle
- [ ] Seasonal (daily, weekly, monhtly) leaderboard
### Profile
- [ ] A profile showing your achievements
### Website
- [ ] A web version of the leaderboard and profile
### RPG Game (?)
- [ ] A game centered around staying in voice chat, something like [idlerpg](idlerpg.net), is really interesting to explore.

## Disclaimer
I made this bot for myself, for my use case, for my small server, and more importantly, to learn and have some fun. Don't expect this bot to perform well on a huge server, or multiple servers. Heck, it doesn't even perform well on a single server.
